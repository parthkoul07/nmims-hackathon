PROBLEM STATMENT: Traffic congestion leads to increased travel time, pollution, and fuel consumption.
Hence the need for an AI-Based Traffic Optimization and Smart Navigation system

Solution Overview: 

The AI-Based Traffic Optimization and Smart Navigation System aims to improve urban mobility by reducing congestion, optimizing traffic signals, and providing eco-friendly navigation options. The system will leverage AI, computer vision, and real-time data analytics to enhance traffic flow, predict congestion patterns, and assist drivers with efficient route planning.

Key Features

1. Navigation System

Eco-Friendly Routing: The system will prioritize the most optimal routes based on speed, fuel efficiency, and minimal traffic lights.

Dijkstra Algorithm for Pathfinding: Weighted graphs will be used to determine the quickest route by assigning values to different road segments based on real-time data.

Traffic Light Awareness: Maps will highlight the locations of traffic lights and their expected wait times to assist drivers in choosing less congested routes.

Weather Integration: Weather conditions will be factored into route recommendations to improve safety and efficiency.



2. Traffic Optimization

Traffic Congestion Detection: AI models will analyze camera feeds and detect the number of cars at intersections to dynamically adjust traffic light timings.

AI-Powered Light Adjustments: AI will count vehicles leaving during green lights and compare with historical data to optimize light duration.

Real-Time Traffic Light Timer Detection:

APIs will be used to detect traffic light durations.

DeepLearning Ai will estimate light durations by using data from Computer vision analyzing stationary vehicles.

Google car APIs may assist in detecting non-functional or improperly managed traffic signals.

Historical Traffic Data Utilization:

Daily/hourly traffic patterns will be stored and used to predict congestion.

Special event/holiday adjustments will be made for anticipated traffic fluctuations.


In the worst case scenario, where the camera shows only one row of cars, or is very blurry, or some other issue we shall use:

Cameras will track the number of cars passing through intersections during green lights.

Traffic flow will be analyzed from previous junctions, traffic lights to predict and mitigate bottlenecks.


3. Data Collection & Insights

Origin-Destination Analysis: The system will identify high-traffic corridors contributing to bottlenecks.

Streetlight Data API (Is not available in India, But we will make one for India with data collection): Insights on congestion, mobility patterns, and rush hour trends will be collected.

Google Maps Traffic Data Collector: Data collection for traffic congestion studies and adaptive improvements.

Simulation for Traffic Light Optimization:

AI models will simulate different scenarios to determine the best light durations.

Vehicle types (cars, trucks, pedestrians) will be assigned different weights for accurate estimations.

Traffic light timing will be dynamically optimized based on AI predictions.


4. AI-Powered Traffic Analysis

Computer Vision for Vehicle & Pedestrian Detection:

AI models will classify and count vehicles, trucks, and pedestrians.

Real-time tracking of congestion will be implemented.

Deep Learning Algorithms:

AI models will learn from historical traffic patterns to predict peak congestion hours.

Adaptive traffic control will be implemented for better signal management.


5. Web-Based Dashboard & User Interface

Web App for Traffic Authorities & Users:

Admins can adjust traffic lights in case of malfunction.

A centralized dashboard will display real-time congestion and traffic patterns.

User Authentication & Public Transport Integration:

A web viewer for mobile devices will allow users to access live traffic data.

APIs from public transport services will be integrated for multimodal travel planning.


Real-Time Traffic Adjustments:

Admins can override AI-controlled signals if needed.

Emergency vehicle prioritization can be implemented to clear congestion when required.
